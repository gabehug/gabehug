Hello! My name is Gabe Hug and I'm a freelance photographer and web designer. 
I began taking photographs 6 years ago, primarily capturing the streets of Chicago.
I have a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Photography and Sustainability Management from Loyola University of Chicago. 
My main experience and passion is in frontend design and development, creating functional and beautiful webpages for small businesses.

I am currently looking for web design projects and photo shoots around the Twin Cities area. 
I have experience designing with React to create functional wepages that solve problems with minimalist user-friendly layouts.
I am passionate about creating sites that show off everything you or your business have to offer.
